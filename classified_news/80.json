Half of the sum would go to buying bitcoin on the market, he said. Other bonds would follow.\nAfter a five year lock-up, El Salvador would start selling some of the bitcoin used to fund the bond to give investors an \"additional coupon\", Mow said, positing that the value of the cryptocurrency would continue to rise robustly.\nEl Salvador buys bitcoin as the digital currency becomes legal tender\n\"This is going to make El Salvador the financial center of the world,\" he said.\nThe bond would be issued on the \"liquid network\", a bitcoin sidechain network. To facilitate the process, El Salvador's government is working on a securities law, and the first license to operate an exchange would go to Bitfinex, Mow said.\nCrypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation behind Mow.\nOnce 10 such bonds were issued, $5 billion in bitcoin would be taken off the market for several years, Mow said. \"And if you get 10 more countries to do these bonds, that's half of bitcoin's market cap right there.\"\nThe \"game theory\" on the bonds gave first issuer El Salvador an advantage, Mow argued, saying: \"If bitcoin at the five-year mark reaches $1 million, which I think it will, they will sell bitcoin in two quarters and recoup that $500 million.\"\n"}
