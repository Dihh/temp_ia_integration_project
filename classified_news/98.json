Several experts even predict that there could be new ETFs for ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\nExpect even more esoteric funds to launch as well.\nFund company Defiance just debuted a new digital revolution ETF geared towards companies that are doing more business with non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, the digital assets stored on a blockchain that have become popular in the art and collectibles world.\nThe Defiance NFT ETF is based off an index and owns shares of companies like bitcoin bank Silvergate (SI), eBay (EBAY), pop culture figurines giant Funko (FNKO) and Playboy owner Plby.\nHow eBay's new CEO turned it into a pandemic winner\nOther passively run ETFs based on indexes continue to remain popular. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood just launched a new fund tied to an index of companies that score well for corporate transparency.\nArk also has a family of actively run ETFs, where managers pick individual stocks or other assets instead of relying on indexes.\nMore actively managed ETFs to rival passive index funds\nNatixis Investment Managers said in a recent report that it expects the amount of assets in actively run ETFs to double in 2022 from this year. And more companies are looking to launch actively managed ETFs that focus on niche sectors of the stock market.\nFund firm VanEck, one of the asset managers that recently launched a bitcoin futures ETF, also has a new actively run ETF geared towards agricultural technology.\nThat fund, named the VanEck Future of Food ETF, has the quirky ticker symbol YUMY and owns shares of companies like indoor farming firm AppHarvest, plant-based milk producer Oatly and tractor maker Deere (DE).\nThere should be more active international ETF launches, too.\nMutual fund giant Vanguard said late last month that it plans to introduce a China Select Stock Fund, which will buy shares of companies based in the world's second-largest economy and won't be based on an index.\n\"An active approach to investing in China, coupled with the ability to invest in a wide range of both onshore and offshore Chinese equities, will provide the fund's portfolio managers flexibility to help navigate the dynamics of potential market constraints and a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape,\" Vanguard said in a news release.\nThe ETF boom is likely to continue fueling strong gains for the big financial firms that dominate the market. Along those lines, shares of iShares owner BlackRock (BLK), SPDR ETF provider State Street (STT) and top fund manager Invesco (IVZ) are each up about 30% so far this year.\n"}
