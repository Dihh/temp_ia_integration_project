As part of a deal with Major League Baseball, umpires wear an FTX patch on their uniforms.\nNot bad for a company that didn't even exist three years ago.\n\"A big piece of this is we are trying to get a lot done in a quick period of time,\" said Bankman-Fried. \"We are really excited about the progress our business has made, but we are also very late to the game.\"\nForget cash. Pay me in bitcoin\nBankman-Fried said FTX is profitable and spends very little on traditional advertising, including on Facebook (FB).\n\"We have a lot of catch-up to do in terms of our branding,\" he said.\nBankman-Fried did not rule out signing more athletes as sponsors, though he suggested he's not in a rush to do more deals. FTX declined to say how big of a stake Ohtani will get.\n\"We are really excited to give our partners a stake because it means we are aligned. As much as we are rooting for them on the field, hopefully they are rooting for us to do well in our arena,\" he said.\nSoaring valuation\nMeanwhile, investors are clamoring to get a piece of the company.\nLast month, FTX raised another $420 million in a funding round that values the company at $25 billion. That's up from the $18 billion valuation FTX achieved just three months prior.\nOhtani's sponsorship deal calls for him to be an ambassador for both the company's main exchange and its US-regulated exchange, known as FTX US.\nBitcoin? Ethereum? Dogecoin? Your guide to the biggest names in crypto\nThe main exchange offers a greater variety of crypto products than FTX US, including certain derivative and prediction vehicles. Due to regulatory restraints, American investors can only trade using FTX US.\nBankman-Fried confirmed FTX is still aiming to acquire a US-based broker dealer that would enable US customers to buy stocks. That would push FTX more squarely into competition with the likes of Robinhood.\n\"It would be a step towards building what we see as a holy grail of a unified financial experience for the consumer,\" Bankman-Fried said.\nRegulatory hurdles\nThe Ohtani news comes as bitcoin, ethereum and other coins take a hit amid ongoing concerns about China's crypto crackdown. Authorities in China blasted bitcoin mining during a press conference on Tuesday as \"extremely harmful.\"\nBankman-Fried said he respects the importance of the news media reporting on the regulatory developments in China, but expressed frustration with the frequency of the headlines around China curtailing the crypto sector.\n\"I do think there is a lot of lazy reporting on it,\" he said. \"If you take the same story and report on it 30 times, that doesn't make it 30 times more important. It's still just one news story.\"\nThe FTX CEO is more hopeful on the US regulatory front and the ability of the crypto industry to work with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.\n\"They are not trying to regulate crypto out of existence, but they want it to have oversight,\" Bankman-Fried said. \"In the end, the strongest version of the crypto industry is one that does have regulatory oversight.\"\n"}
