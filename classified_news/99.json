The trial began on Nov. 1.\n\"This has been a remarkably good outcome and I feel completely vindicated,\" Wright said in a video message. \"There are still more fights. We are going to make everything change: cryptocurrency to digital cash the way it's meant to be.\"\nA beginner's guide to crypto lingo\nAccording to court papers, the 1.1 million bitcoin had been mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose October 2008 white paper \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" described a framework for what would become bitcoin.\nWright claimed in 2016 that he was Nakamoto, which was a pseudonym. The claim has been disputed.\nKleiman's family contended that he and Wright had been friends and business partners, but that Wright stole the bitcoin stemming from their relationship.\nIn a statement, lawyers for W&K and Kleiman's estate said they were \"immensely gratified\" that the jury awarded the $100 million in intellectual property rights, and help give the Kleimans \"their fair share of what Dave helped create.\"\nDave Kleiman died in April 2013.\nThe Australia-born Wright, who later moved to London, in May sued software developers to secure around 111,000 bitcoin now worth about $5.4 billion that he claimed he owns.\n"}
