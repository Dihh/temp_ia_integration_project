On Thursday it was worth about $65.\nThe World Health Organization, which on Friday named the new COVID-19 variant Omicron, said as more countries reported cases there is a \"very high\" global risk of surges, although scientists have said it could take weeks to understand its severity.\nBitcoin (ARSC) suffered its worst day in two months on Friday, dropping by more than 8% as investors dumped stocks and other riskier assets in favor of perceived safe havens like the dollar. It has since recovered nearly all of its losses, with global markets gaining a semblance of calm on Monday.\nForget cash. Pay me in bitcoin\nFrom \"squid game\" to dogecoin, minor cryptocurrencies have this year benefited from links to memes or internet culture, recording rapid booms and busts while more mainstream names such as bitcoin soar in popularity.\nIt's not clear when the Omicron token was launched. Data on its price at CoinGecko was only available from Nov. 8, while a Telegram channel under the name OmicDAO was launched a day earlier.\nReuters was not able to reach anyone representing Omicron for comment.\n"}
