That's an 860% increase from the same period last year.\nA Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment on the petition.\nBut during an earnings call this week, CEO Vladimir Tenev said that his platform will \"carefully evaluate whether we can add new coins in a way that's safe for customers and in line with regulatory requirements.\"\n\"We feel very, very good about the coins that we're currently listing on our platform. And for any new coins that we add, we want to feel equally, if not more good,\" he added.\nShiba inu coin also surged earlier this week, but lost some recent gains after Tesla CEO Elon Musk — who is a big fan of dogecoin — tweeted that he does not own any shiba inu coin.
